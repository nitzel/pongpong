# pongpong
Pong in C++ with SFML
*A little adventure back to the world of C++, Graphics and maybe some OpenGL*

### Current status is:
- Player vs Player using Up/Down arrows and W/S keys to control the corresponding right/left paddle to keep the opponent from scoring
- AI vs AI (though this is not very interesting, the AI is merely deflecting the ball but not doing any attacks). When the game starts, the ball will fly in a horizontal line so the AI has actually nothing to do in this game mode. Change the starting angle to see some action.
- Player vs AI (not as easy as it sounds)
- There is a menu available :)

### ToDo
- [ ] Pause state
- [ ] Highscore

Yes, the code is dirty. It's all about quick and dirty - getting something playable.
And indeed, it is already playable :)
But to build it, you will need a c++ compiler (e.g. GCC6.1 and SFML)

PS: *I hope this is not too embarassing to be saved online ...*
