# pongpong
Pong in C++ with SFML
*A little adventure back to the world of C++, Graphics and maybe some OpenGL*

Yes, the code is dirty. It's all about quick and dirty - getting something playable.
And indeed, it is already playable :)
But to build it, you will need a c++ compiler (e.g. GCC6.1 and SFML)

PS: I hope this is not too embarassing to be saved online ...
